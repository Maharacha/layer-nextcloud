# How to use the nextcloud charm

This nextcloud server will default run on port 80.

Relate this charm with either mysql or postgresql.

### Example deploy
Below is a manual test deployment without SSL/TLS using a single machine and 4G ram. 
```
juju deploy cs:~erik-lonroth/nextcloud --constraints="mem=4G"
juju deploy postgresql --to 0
juju relate postgresql:db nextcloud:postgres
juju expose nextcloud
```

### Example deploy with separate storage
This deploys nextcloud and places the data directory on a separate disk.
```
juju deploy cs:~erik-lonroth/nextcloud --storage data=120G --constraints="mem=8G"
juju deploy postgresql --to 0
juju relate postgresql:db nextcloud:postgres
juju expose nextcloud
```

You can use the [juju storage] functionality to achieve the same thing on many clouds.

Attaching storage to a already running instance of this charm is supported as:

```bash
juju add-storage nextcloud/0 data=ebs,10G,1
```
The charm will then:
* move the current /var/www/nextcloud/data location to a backup directory
 /var/www/nextcloud/data-XXXXXXXXX.
* rsync data to from the data directory into the new disk 
* Create a symlink from /var/www/nextcloud/data to the new disk with the migrated data.

Use this with caution of you have alot (terrabytes) of data already in your installation 
as a migration process of that sort can be scary.

For a GB:s of data under /var/www/nextcloud/data, you should be good and no data will be deleted.

### Example deploy of a bundle
The [nextcloud-collabora-tls bundle](https://jujucharms.com/u/erik-lonroth/nextcloud-collabora-tls/bundle/)
deploys a full collaboration office suite with [collabora online](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/)
with letsencrypt SSL certificates.

### Initial login
http://my.nextcloud.ip/

username: admin

password: mypassword

Change default passwords as soon as possible.

## Configuration
The charm has a few configuration variables you might want to set, depending on your needs. 

A reconfig will trigger a 'systemctl reload apache2'

- **fqdn**:

Set this if you have a DNS entry, E.g. nextcloud.example.com. You will avoid "untrusted domain" messages
in your browser with a valid domain name set here. 
```
juju config nextcloud fqdn=nextcloud.example.com
```

- **php_upload_max_filesize**:

Set this to a value reflecting the files you expect coming via the file sync. Default is 512MB.
```
juju config nextcloud php_upload_max_filesize="1G"
```
See the configuration (config.yaml) for more options.

## Actions
This charm provides the following actions that might be useful.

### action: add-trusted-domain
This action adds a trusted_domain through the nextcloud [occ] command.
```
juju run-action nextcloud/0 add-trusted-domain index=4 domain="nextcloud.my.local.domain"
```
The server will now accept requests via http://nextcloud.my.local.domain

### action: add-missing-indices
This action runs 'occ db:add-missing-indices' as part of optimizing the database, 
which can be done safely while the server is online.

```juju run-action nextcloud/0 add-missing-indices```

### action: convert-filecache-bigint
This action runs 'occ db:aconvert-filecache-bigint' as part of optimizing the database.
This also takes care of placing the server in maintenance while the action is running.

```juju run-action nextcloud/0 convert-filecache-bigint```

### action: maintenance
Takes the site in (enable=true) or out (enable=false) of maintenance mode.

```juju run-action nextcloud/0 maintenance enable=true```


## Installed version of Nextcloud
This charm installs a fairly recent release from [nextcloud releases] defined in the apache.yaml file.
If you need to install another version as part of your deploy - talk to the charm [Maintainer].

## Upgrading Nextcloud
Its safe to use the Nextcloud web-gui for normal operational upgrades. 
You find it in the "Overview" section in the deployed nextcloud.
